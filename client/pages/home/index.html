          was formed to provide a local platform for information sharing among .NET developers in the 
          Duluth/Superior area.  The group meets the second Thursday of each month to learn about and 
          discuss a wide variety of developement related topics.
      </p>

          While the primary focus of this group is .NET, we are open to discussing other programming languages
          and tool chains. If you program with another technology stack, come and share your experience and see 
          what you've been missing... :)
